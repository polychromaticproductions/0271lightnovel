   <p> So for this art, I decided, what it would look like after she escaped the facility, i also made the background monochrome so you can focus on her, maybe I should have put blood splatters on her but i do like it.<p>

   <p> For this one, I was mish-mashing covers of songs I liked, and I wanted to make her look chaotic, look at her go!<p>

   <p> What can I say about this one? I mean, she's sticker-like and I like using this image as her key art<p>

<p> This was one of my first art pieces of 0271/Reini Nanaichi, perhaps concept art, I love concept art so I know someone out there will also love it.<p>

	<p>This one looks like a marble statue and I use it across my social media pages, I made this while I was in birmingham.<p>

	<p> This would be the SII logo, Secretnova interplanetary intelligence, you'll see them later on but not too later as it does appear in one of the more first chapters.<p>

	<p>This was one idea for a cover, I wanted to represent what that other part was or as I like to codename her, kakera-chan but sometimes I feel uncomfortable using that honorific for some reason, it fits so much however, so I just call the other side Kakera, I got her name from an old song named 'Hoshi no kakera', which means fragments of a star, please go listen to it!.</p>
