<h1> CHAPTER 5</H1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 5;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been two weeks, and Kesshu saw that Reini was recovering, but she hadn&rsquo;t touched the magical keyboard yet, she was still too nervous to. But he could see her playing on the grand piano occasionally. One time as he walked through the hallway, he heard a beautiful symphony, it began off gently and then built up, and the motif was familiar too. He seemed flabbergasted because he knew how hard this song was. This random child they found was surely able to be something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;La Campanella! Liszt!&rdquo; He said with excitement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I guess everyone knows La Campanella. Maybe I should play something else after this. This is a beautiful piano.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is an ancient piano, all the way from the 19th century, I think the Meiji restoration, Mirai told me it belonged to a pianist, her name was Yuki, and her father started to learn how to make pianos after spending some time in Europe along with the typical traditional instruments the Otokabe family have been making instruments for many years, the instrument maker from long ago made this piano for his daughter and it&rsquo;s been in Tatsu&rsquo;s family since then, you can ask Mirai about it. It seems you have a knack for this stuff.&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think of playing the piano as a treat. If I behave well, I get music lessons. I also found some old MIDI keyboards in a random dumpster and practised.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re resourceful, but try not to dumpster dive. That&rsquo;s not hygienic. I do understand it, though: no income, no parents.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Also do I have to go to school on the day after tomorrow?&rdquo; Reini asked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, you have to go to school, there are many women who risked their lives for your right to go to school, only for you to say you don&rsquo;t want to go to school, you are going to school, and there will be no gift presence there because it&rsquo;s a nearby school, you&rsquo;ll like this school, if there are any problems you can tell me, we&rsquo;ll sort them out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, what kind of school is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A school where the best educators in Japan are, the best money can buy, we think you'll bring out your best potential there, it&rsquo;s a full school, ranging from young children to high school 3rd years, you may have to introduce yourself when you go there.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I mean, I would have to.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I guess you could make some friends your age, hopefully, I wasn&rsquo;t sociable when I was at school, so I didn&rsquo;t make many friends.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m weird, I doubt I&rsquo;ll make any friends.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll always have me as a friend, I&rsquo;m always free!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini would remember that sentiment, she didn&rsquo;t know what friends were, but she wanted to know why so many people talked about having friends, Maybe it was like how close she was with Subject 6174; before she died by succumbing to her dystrophy. That&rsquo;s all she knew, she didn&rsquo;t even see her die because Gift thought it would be too much for her and distract her to witness her dying. Maybe they were right, being there as someone you knew died in front of you would certainly affect you, but at least she's got to see her. She remembered when she was first brought into the Tokyo lab from Greece. 6174 was super-intelligent but suffered from severe muscular dystrophy, so they brought her to the Tokyo lab to help develop a cure for her dystrophy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were so many things she wanted to say to 6174, She didn&rsquo;t have a photo on her, to look at when she was down, only a memory, well, plenty of them, like when she first saw a bubble or the time when she stole a small slice of cake from the kitchen to give to the subject 6174; to see her smile as she ate that cake, that was certainly a moment Reini wanted to have forever.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, 6174, only a constant to remember you by; how she changed everyone she met. And how she changed everyone upon her death and would have loved the world- if she was free.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai wandered the halls as she usually did, her stature was that of an average-sized woman and her face was that of an unageing titan that had seen people come and go while she stayed in her youthful cage of a body- was it a cage, at least she was given offerings, and praised, and many people asked her for help. She doesn&rsquo;t mind being here though, it was much better than space, much better than being around that disgusting individual Thanatos. Whatever, the past is the past and there are no time travellers here to help her, do time travellers exist? She only knew of Chronos but he quickly vanished after realising how bad of a person Thanatos was, many Titans vanished.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now the higher being assigned her here and she finally found peace. However she had a weird feeling lingering around her recently, it felt like you slightly remembered something you forgot about mid-conversation or how your whole family was there but you felt as if somebody was missing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew the Otokabe family was now in small numbers, only picking up auras from 2 living family members, Tatsu didn&rsquo;t want to remarry and only the Higher Being knew who that second member was, if only she could investigate further. She knew Tatsu&rsquo;s daughter was killed off over twelve years ago, during World War 4.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai checked the supply cupboards, her pads went missing, and she was saving these for next month. But she wasn&rsquo;t mad. She knew someone probably needed them so she would bring up that point during dinner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai also wanted to see Reini transform, but Reini was always hesitant- Mirai only wanted to see how her body reacted to the powers, just to see if she needed any adjustments. Before Reini started school, Mirai got Reini to train beforehand and was confident that Reini could transform. Nothing was stopping Reini, she could do it physically but Mirai wanted Reini to go ahead because she was still anxious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She walked through the hallways and heard some piano playing, she slowly opened the divider to hear Claire de Lune, Mirai was impressed with her playing, and she slowly went up to Reini. Reini was too fixated on her playing to notice Miari behind her shoulder, she felt something behind her back and her music went to a sudden stop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She slowly turned to see Mirai looking at her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, hey Mirai, do you need something?&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh yes, it&rsquo;s time for training,&rdquo; Mirai said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;But you said I was exempt today.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, just one little thing, pretty please!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Fine then.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini followed Mirai to the facility. Mirai pressed a remote and the lights turned off, with a spotlight being the only thing illuminating the room; and up came a small podium with a keyboard bag, Mirai knew what she was doing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; Mirai said, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve earned it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini wasn&rsquo;t sure about it, she was hesitant to touch it even. She just stared at it awkwardly and Mirai let out a little sigh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Young lady, if you don&rsquo;t take it, may the higher being be merciful!&rdquo; Mirai exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn&rsquo;t know if she should stay quiet or apologise, she wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do, so she slowly approached the bag and unzipped it, she saw it was quite a unit; an Otokabe keyboard, after all, instruments were their speciality, and as well as a 6.25 it had a 3.5mm jack in the back for midi connections, she knew how much of a nuisance the bigger jack ports were, she felt it was better for midi keyboards just to have a 3.5mm port as it&rsquo;s easier to find 3.5mm wires.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai noticed Reini inspecting the unit; Mirai could tell she wanted to inspect the instrument rather than use it. Mirai didn&rsquo;t want to nudge the poor girl further.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You press the transform button and play a certain quick melody to allow you to transform,&rdquo; Mirai said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room was a little silent at the moment. Mirai talked again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It also picks up on your intent to transform.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet again, the room was silent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the melody,&rdquo; Mirai added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She pulled out a sheet from a pocket and unfolded it- sheet music, titled &lsquo;transforming melody&rsquo;. It seemed to be at a measure of 4/4 and a bpm of 120, something usually typical, most of the chords were heavenly and it was only a quick 3-second flourish of major-based notes that mostly seemed uplifting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, thanks.&rdquo; Reini said, &ldquo;This button, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She did as she was told and then after a bright flash, her entire outfit and hair changed; now drilled pigtails, fell and dangled a little, her stance conveyed a sense of perplexion, her knees met and her shoulders slanted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Did I flash you, during the transformation sequence?&rdquo; Reini muttered as she held her skirt down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, no, well, you sort of flash-banged my eyes though. All I see, and everyone else, is a bright white light flash for a second and then your outfit changes,&rdquo; Mirai explained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Huh, I always thought they had to wait for the transformation sequence, like let's say I confront a villain or something and then I transform.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well it feels like that or something, for you, you go through a transformation sequence, but for us, you change in a second, the uniform helps you with certain attacks and adapts during certain environments.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Phew, I thought I would be attacked during the sequence.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, I knew someone who was as surprised as you were, surprised that magical girls didn't go through the sequence as enemies are waiting.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s convenient.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai wheels over a mirror to Reini; so she can see what she had transformed into. It took her a second to truly grasp the change. Her hair is tied up in two neat coils rather than free wavy hair- her typical style.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all honesty, she hadn&rsquo;t been this well dressed, not since she went out almost a month ago, she felt like some sort of princess, she felt pretty for once. She wanted to cry, tears of joy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So, I figured you like the outfit then, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini stood in silence in front of the mirror. She turned to Mirai.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Why yes,&rdquo; she replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good, the outfit will always fit the age and style preference of the user, if you look under the skirt, there are yoga shorts rather than just pants </span><b>(or underwear for my American readers),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I&rsquo;ll be honest, yoga shorts are a lifesaver, I just don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with just pants, one, they expose too much for me and two, what if I leave a snail trail by accident or something!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, you call it a snail trail?&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I mean it makes sense. Doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They stood there in silence, the only noise being white noise hissing from the ventilators. They blinked at each other, not sure what topic to bring up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ahem, have you seen my pads anywhere, I have such a bad sense of direction,&rdquo; Mirai asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I took them, I kinda used up a lot.&rdquo; Reini said.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sorry, they were so heavy, I did put them away in the bathroom drawers when I was done, there is no point really in putting them back I guess, there&rsquo;s only one pad left, used them a lot last week, I will pay you back if you want.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh no, poor thing, you don&rsquo;t have to pay for hygiene products in this house, you don&rsquo;t have to pay for anything except for luxuries you want with your allowance, you should get heavy flow pads&rdquo; Mirai said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You mean that?&rdquo; Reini asked in confusion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You are a minor under our responsibility and you are also a talent, by being a talent you perform and you get compensated, thus technically giving you an allowance, we have to get your idol uniform tailored next week, can&rsquo;t wear the same thing when you perform and fight evil.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, alright then, will it be adorable,&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll make sure of it too, by the way, I forgot to tell you it&rsquo;s such short notice too but one of our acts from Europe is coming over for the weekend, I'm sorry I didn&rsquo;t inform you sooner.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m very glad then, she&rsquo;s from Ukraine </span><b>(this is for that Ukrainian girl from my school who&rsquo;s probably done with year 13, she asked for this)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and this is also some very important SII stuff, I&rsquo;ll check if Tatsu is okay with you sitting in on in the meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Why might I have to sit in the meeting?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It might concern you,&rdquo; Mirai said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Alright, I got that, uh how do you de-transform?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, got that, is it okay if I take a picture, it&rsquo;s your first time and I thought I&rsquo;d keep a memory of that, and you would just play the melody in minor to de-transform, yet again it picks up your intent so you don&rsquo;t do it on accident.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Go ahead, I appreciate you asking.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took out her camera and a picture printed, the pose was obvious but it looked a little stiff. She had a neutral expression and her hands joined in the middle. It was certainly a modest pose compared to her frivolous outfit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai shows Reini the photo briefly, she then looks at it and then gives it back, she plays the melody in minor and then de-transforms, she&rsquo;s back to normal again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, how was that?&rdquo; She asks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I felt different&hellip; for sure,&rdquo; Reini replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was most definitely different, for sure. She wasn&rsquo;t sure what it was but she was most definitely different in some way. She went back up with Mirai and saw someone at the door, she had warm deep brown hair and freckles and looked tall and attractive, she wore an office-style suit with a bow scarf and had rectangular glasses, she also had a briefcase with her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Is that her?&rdquo; she quietly asked Kesshu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could hear them, regardless of how quiet they were, the hallways were empty of sound. The woman slowly approached Reini, not with a slow cautious pace but an easier pace of walking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hello, I'm Vera, a part-time popstar and licensed neurologist/ therapist, what&rsquo;s your name?.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Reini replied bluntly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh uh, good morning then,&rdquo; Vera said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini stared at her for a moment, and then she blinked and jumped in realisation, she just said her name was &lsquo;good morning&rsquo; Who did that, was she sort of messed up after the transformation?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No sorry, it&rsquo;s Reini, I am sorry,&rdquo; Reini added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s nice to meet you Reini, I'm meeting with Mr. Otokabe and I&rsquo;ll also have a performance in Tokyo.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh okay, well, I&rsquo;ll be in my room if you need me,&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went to her room bored out of her mind but noticed something different, was it the lighting? She walked around her room mindlessly. And then she heard a knock on her door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Reini?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She opened the door to see Mirai with many things, an assortment of old and new things. Mirai came into the room and put the stuff on the bed. Reini watched as she sorted the things out slightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I have things for you,&rdquo; Mirai said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Reini said, &ldquo;I have far too many things!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Far too many? Your drawers are empty, and you have a figure, just a figure, some of these are old things, hand-me-downs, but I did get you some new things.&rdquo; Mirai said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think this is enough, Mirai,&rdquo; Reini said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What do you mean this is all enough!&rdquo; Mirai exclaimed, &ldquo;I am simply filling up your drawers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s fine, thanks a lot.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was too much stuff for Reini to handle, she didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it, it was too much for her to handle, what did she even do to deserve all this? It felt like a trick, she wasn&rsquo;t used to all this affection. Perhaps it was because she was never given this many things, let alone a room like she is entitled to. It all felt weird for her, this didn&rsquo;t feel normal for her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, Vera wants to see you by the way!&rdquo; Mirai said, &ldquo;I just got it through my phone, she should be in the living room!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, okay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went to the living room, a little scared because she knew that being called in by someone meant she was in trouble, that&rsquo;s how she did it when she was captive, she hadn&rsquo;t been in any sort of captivity or school for a year, she mostly took online classes to keep her mind stimulated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hello Reini, sit anywhere you want, I mean, you live here?&rdquo; Vera said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Am I in&hellip; oh sorry, old habit,&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay, think of my face as a face you can trust, I know we just met today so let&rsquo;s take it easy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini was non-confrontational, but she had so much she wanted to tell her, but she didn&rsquo;t want to be judged. Would she think she would be too weird if she went directly with her issues?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, let's start, how was this week?&rdquo; Vera asked</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I'm not sure, I felt a little overwhelmed with everything, but I guess I'm settling in here great, but I don't understand why they're being so nice to me,&rdquo; Reini said&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So you feel overwhelmed?&rdquo; Vera replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, I do, I'm sorry, it's just that I'm having a hard time telling you how I truly feel.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That's okay, we can take it easy and start with baby steps, after all, we can't build houses without a foundation, but feel free to say whatever you want to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I guess when you put it like that it makes sense,&rdquo; Reini added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was rubbing her hands and picking at some bits, and even biting her fingers slightly. Therapy sure is scary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I'm not sure, maybe it's because I want nothing to do with Gift, I just want to be left alone, and sort of discarded, forgotten about, like a normal person, I don't want anyone to care about me nor do I want to get things when I haven't deserved to get them, inherently I know I'm not normal, and I'll never be, especially because I'm made to be a killing machine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I see, from what I've been told and what's written down here, Gift Developments forcefully detained you,&rdquo; Vera said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, that's right.&rdquo; Reini bluntly stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And how does that make you feel.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Permission to be vulgar?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, it's therapy, you can say whatever is on your mind and nobody will tell you off or tell on you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I fucking hate those little shits, I hope everyone who works there&hellip;well...&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That was vulgar, but it's therapy, would you say you have an outlet for this,&rdquo; Vera asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Outlet?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Like the one in your walls?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No, I mean a way you let out all your anger.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Now that I think about it?&rdquo; Reini said, &ldquo;Not really, Miss.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A common way to destress is stress toys, I always bring plenty of stress toys, feel some while we talk, I'll let you keep your favourite!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt some of the stress toys, some were too soft, some were too hard, and some of them had a texture that irked her, but she found the perfect one, smooth, not too soft, slimy, sticky. It was perfect. She wanted to keep this one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Is there anything else You wanted to talk about?&rdquo; Vera asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, sometimes I black out,&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That takes a lot of courage to admit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I don't remember what happens, but it happens like once every month.&rdquo; Reini said, &ldquo;I'm not sure why I'm saying this in therapy, it happens when I have my period, and usually everything is a mess.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Interesting, what else do you want to say about this.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;At first, I was confused, I guess, I mean the first time it happened, I did black out and then suddenly I could feel more than blood on myself, I could feel gibs, remains, I had been killed, I don't remember it. Maybe it was her.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s okay, I would like some context,&rdquo; Vera asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It was the day I escaped, I thought I was going to die because my cramps hurt a lot. It hurt so much I blacked out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It's okay, We'll find something to help with that, can I have your permission to refer anything that might help medically to Dr Carter, for anything concerning physical?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Her? Yeah sure, she's a nice woman, I also have something else to tell you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is a safe space, of course, you can tell me!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I was told I have an incurable developmental disability, but nobody told me what it was, it wasn't like they said it nicely either, obviously I don't have any medical records to tell you what I know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find it together, do you mind if I tell your guardians what I found so far, just to help you find whatever you're looking for, we can pick what you want me to say to your guardian.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I'll allow it, only the important bits,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I understand, I have found some symptoms and I think I might be able to help you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That's cool, looks like the hour is up!&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I'll be here for a while, practising for my concert downstairs as im also a singer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That's good to know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini left the room to get some snacks, she saw Kesshu in the hallway, she didn't want to get in his way much so she tried to be very quick and quiet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Have you seen my leg braces?&rdquo; Kesshu asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini didn't know where. But she didn&rsquo;t want to be useless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I'm not sure, have you tried the training facility?&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I haven't, but I can't use the stairs without my mobility aids, which are my leg braces. I'll check in the kitchen, it's pretty hard using crutches for me, so I prefer my braces.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I'll check them for you,&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Thanks, kid, I know, it must be burdensome for a man my age to be in such a state, I'm sorry about that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Don't be, it's not your fault, besides, I heard what happened anyway.&rdquo; Reini said &ldquo;And even if someone didn't tell me, I am not one to judge, how old are you anyway?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I'm turning 34 this year.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini was surprised, he looked much younger than that, she wasn&rsquo;t sure what it was, good genetics? he was mistaken for a university-age man once, Reini always assumed he was 20-something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Wow, you look much younger than that.&rdquo; Reini complimented.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Awww thanks, that's flattering,&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Haha, you're old enough to be my dad but you look old enough to be my brother or something!&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I don't think I look that young!&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I'll check downstairs for your braces and I'll get them back to you,&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Appreciate it, kid.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went down the stairs to look for his leg braces, she heard the hum of washing machines and dryers and saw Mirai with a sewing needle. She slowly went in, wondering what Mirai was doing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Have you seen Kesshu&rsquo;s leg braces?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh yes I have, I think he forgot it was wash day, his braces are in the dryer now, it shouldn&rsquo;t be long, just call him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Could you call him? I get nervous on the phone.&rdquo; Reini asked</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, poor girl&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered to herself &ldquo;Yes I will!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She used her phone to call him, to remind him it was wash day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s wash day to day, your braces are in the dryer, just give it a few minutes and they&rsquo;ll be dry,&rdquo; Mirai says on the phone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, I remember now, that&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t find some of my T-shirts, have you seen my crust pants, you haven&rsquo;t put them in the machine, have you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What? No? I&rsquo;d never! I made that mistake about 200 years ago, they&rsquo;re in the freezer, just spray them with germ killer or something.&rdquo; Mirai said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Reini will get your braces, I know today, that your pain has flared up a bit more so I&rsquo;m gonna do anything else you need me to do?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine, I don&rsquo;t have anything intense, bye!.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He hung up the phone, it was clear the conversation was already finished. The chime rang on the dryer, which signalled that the dryer was done.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Reini, the dryer is done, also, how&rsquo;s Vera settling in right now?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing fine, I&nbsp; had my first therapy session with her and it was something, I've never had therapy before.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I'm glad you&rsquo;re adjusting. If it&rsquo;s okay, would you like to help me fold the clothes after this load? I would appreciate some help.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chore? Finally, she didn&rsquo;t get much of those, but she wanted to be competent. She wanted to be useful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Will do ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; Reini cried out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She got the leg braces out of the dryer and had them in a basket, climbing up the stairs to get them to him, she walked through the hallway and saw him in the kitchen, he was sitting down, on his phone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I ordered some pizza, it should come here in a few minutes, about 15 minutes, are you okay with teriyaki chicken, everyone else was fine with it?&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That sounds very cool, how big is the pizza?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;18 inches with 20 slices, that should suffice for 5 people I believe, I also ordered some wings and fries and garlic sauce and ketchup, I also ordered some very spicy chilli sauce, and we'll also have soda.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini was excited, it sounded very tasty, she couldn&rsquo;t wait until it arrived, her mouth was watering at the thought of the food that was arriving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, I forgot, here&rsquo;s your leg braces.&rdquo; Reini said.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Kesshu said as he put them on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teriyaki chicken pizza sounded very delicious, and with a ton of wings and fries, it sounded very bougie. She couldn't afford a cheesecake less than a month ago but all this food, and delivery too? She was lucky to afford ramen packets back then, that cheesecake meant she was not going to have food for days but it was worth it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teriyaki chicken pizza, and having it delivered to you&hellip;this is the life. She was very lucky. Perhaps she could consider herself extremely privileged, this was the life a princess would have.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;mmm, so tasty,&rdquo; she muttered to herself as her mouth watered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kesshu couldn't help but notice how much she was enjoying this, visibly, it was like she had never eaten before, which was true to an extent. She didn&rsquo;t have access to tasteful, nutritional meals most of her life. And during these two weeks, she would eat every meal like it was her last. Fair enough because they'd only feed her bland slop every meal at Gift's lab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He heard the doorbell ring, he was still finishing off with the straps of his leg braces but he couldn't finish that quickly, Reini had run to the door to make sure the delivery guy wouldn't leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Pizza for&hellip;K.Kawaki at&hellip;Otokabe residence?&rdquo; the delivery person said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes. That's correct, He&rsquo;s fixing his mobility aids at the moment.&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Enjoy your pizza!&rdquo; the delivery guy said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Thank you too!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guy giggled a little, Reini realised what she did and it was slightly embarrassing but nothing to get embarrassed about. She looked at the box and was excited to eat it. The wings soda and fries were in a bag that was in her arms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Did you get the pizza!&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, that smells so delicious, where did you get it?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Finley's, they're the best pizza chain around,&rdquo; Kesshu replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Woah, Finley's&hellip; that's like the high-end stuff,&rdquo; Reini exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It's not that expensive, but it's great in quality, that's why there are thousands of shops worldwide, at least 1 for each country or city perhaps.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This looks so delicious, the days of bin-diving are behind me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;bin-diving?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I mean I was practically penniless,&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I know, sorry, don't mind me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Poor child&rsquo; he thought to himself, he wishes she never had to suffer. No child ever has to suffer. That's what he thinks, but some children do suffer, and it makes him sick. But he has to stomach it at the moment, he just brought some food and he didn&rsquo;t feel like eating much today anyway because he felt sort of sick, maybe he could drink some water. He decided to lay everything down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Bring everyone over, Reini, can you be a dear and call them over?&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Will do,&rdquo; Reini responded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went downstairs, where Mirai was still working on some things, she went up to her, slightly, and announced that there was food. Mirai seemed to acknowledge. Reini went from the wash basement to the living room, knocking on the sliding door and she heard a &lsquo;come in&rsquo; from Tatsu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Come for dinner, we ordered takeout,&rdquo; Reini said,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I will, I just need to finish up discussing manager stuff with Vera, thanks for telling me though.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Alright, then I&rsquo;ll finish up with Kesshu.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went back into the kitchen and helped Kesshu with anything else that was remaining. The food smelled so warm, and she couldn&rsquo;t wait. If she dived in immediately, it would be rude.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t dive in immediately, let&rsquo;s wait for everyone else,&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh okay then, it shouldn&rsquo;t be too long then,&rdquo; Reini exclaimed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;After dinner, let's play some games, I&rsquo;ll log into my account and then we can install a game you like. Okay?&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Do you have S**** A******** 2?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Why yes I do, i love that game.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Wow! I love that game. It&rsquo;s crazy, but I relate a lot to its antihero, S****w. But I&rsquo;m no ultimate life form, haha. If anything, four 4s was that, I wish they&rsquo;d port his spin-off onto PC, like an actual port. I would starve for days to afford it on sale, but it&rsquo;s not like I have any games yet,&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh no, please don&rsquo;t do that. That&rsquo;s not a good idea.&rdquo; Kesshu said, &ldquo;And yes, I love that game too.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I mean I can afford food and games now!&rdquo; Reini said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been able to eat this much before and have something fun.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Just ask us, for anything, as long as it&rsquo;s within bounds,&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone else came to the table, everyone was there, and so was Vera, she was their guest for now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Before we tuck in, let's say thanks, for this meal!&rdquo; Tatsu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini was quick about it, she had given thanks for her food and then tucked in, eating quickly, it was clear she hadn&rsquo;t had anything this nice to eat; which was fine considering how she was brought up. Peckish was the least you could use to describe her. It tasted so good, she was making noises she didn&rsquo;t know she was making.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;How is it Reini, good isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Tatsu asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you could order luxury food like this!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s something you can get easily, it's fast food,&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Considering how she was brought up, I think you need to give her some leeway, this is expensive for her, she probably couldn&rsquo;t even make herself a struggle meal,&rdquo; Mirai said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s safe to assume.&rdquo; Vera added, &ldquo;She had no income, and she was living in abhorrent conditions, they would have demolished that building I heard, and then she would be on the streets again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Glad we found her then,&rdquo; Kesshu stated, &ldquo;It breaks my heart to hear how she lived before and how she was treated before, she doubts herself too much.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Aww look at that, paternal instinct,&rdquo; Mirai said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Usually kess is such a tough person, but he cares about the well-being of children,&rdquo; Tatsu replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Kess like this for quite a while, he&rsquo;d make a great girl dad!&rdquo; Vera exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Who knows whose daughter she is, but she&rsquo;ll be like one to me,&rdquo; Kesshu exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The adults kept on teasing and joking with each other, Reini was just eating her food, she was eating her fries and looked up when she realised that they were talking about her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Were you guys talking about me?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, we were,&rdquo; Mirai said &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s about how much we appreciate each other and you especially, if I perceived correctly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini cleaned up her fingers and bits of her face using a tissue, she drank some soda to clear up her throat a bit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh okay, I guess I appreciate you guys a lot, you&rsquo;ve done too much for me, it&rsquo;s more than what I think I deserve but thank you so much for it, I am extremely grateful.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai raised her glass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A toast, for Reini!&rdquo; she announced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They clinked their soda glasses in the middle of the table. Then retracting them back, then finishing their food.</span></p>
