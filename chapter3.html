<h1> CHAPTER 3</H1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her new room looked pre-occupied but at least it didn&rsquo;t have mould or walls that fell apart with a singular draft of wind. It looked like a collector&rsquo;s room, but at least she liked that it had shelves. It looked like there was a girl living there before, yet it looked untouched, undisturbed, only maintained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Do you like the new room?&rdquo; Kesshu asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s very pink and green,&rdquo; Reini stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Is there something wrong with that, we can redecorate it, it&rsquo;s been like that for more than a decade.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truly, Reini loved how comfy and welcoming it looked. It didn&rsquo;t look sterile, which was good. She wanted this room in particular, even though she knew it was the only spare room Tatsu could offer. She could imagine rolling around in that comfy bed filled with pillows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;By the way, we did get a new mattress, and cleaned everything, this room is older than you, but please give us a yell if something is wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Thanks, for the room, truly,&rdquo; Reini exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Alright, do you need help with setting anything up?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Not really, I&rsquo;ll set up my PC on my own,&rdquo; Reini said as she unzipped her suitcase and unpacked her things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kesshu could see the fossil of a PC Reini was carrying around; he felt bad because he knew how old these parts were, the only thing that looked somewhat new was the SSD inside the PC, any computer nerd knows a new SSD is better than an old one because the cycles would be used up if you used an old one, he thought to himself, it was this girl&rsquo;s birthday a day or two ago, he wasn&rsquo;t sure whether to comment on it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey kid, where did you get those parts?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I went to scrapyards,&rdquo; Reini replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I see, have you ever wanted a newer PC?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Maybe, I wish I had the money.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I have the money, I could buy you a new setup entirely if you wanted.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;you would spend that much? you think I deserve that?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini wasn&rsquo;t prepared for this situation. A free PC wasn't something that she considered a possibility at all, but she didn&rsquo;t know what to say, did she even do something to deserve such an expensive reward, did she need to labour for this?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sure kid, team blue or team red?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh um, definitely Team Red, in terms of PC parts, do I have to earn it or something? I&rsquo;m confused that you would give something to me without me deserving it..&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kesshu felt like maybe she didn&rsquo;t understand the concept of a present, he didn&rsquo;t want to be &lsquo;gentle&rsquo; yet he didn&rsquo;t want to be rough, he didn&rsquo;t want to infantilize her, he intended to help her throughout the few years of childhood she had left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kesshu explained, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a present, I&rsquo;m giving it because uh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was her birthday, recently, the other day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It was your 12th a few days ago, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Kesshu continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Mhm!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go, for now, if you need anything just ask Tatsu or me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini slowly closed the door and then doodled in her notebook, the page was sprawling with curses and heavy sketching, it looked rageful but somehow pretty metal. She also had a few cans hidden in her backpack, these were paint cans, and they meant business. She packed some things into a backpack and those paint cans, and she stuffed many things into that bag but they weren&rsquo;t enough to run away, she wasn&rsquo;t even planning on running away, she just wanted to let her anger out in a way that involved vandalism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she was halfway out the window, she heard Kesshu open the door, she was caught trying to sneak out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah I&rsquo;m sorry, will I be punished for sneaking out? Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the shops what- Use the front door, you&rsquo;re not a prisoner here!&rdquo; Kesshu stated, "What did you wanna do though?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;N-Nothing?&rdquo; Reini stuttered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hold on&hellip;Shake your bag.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini had no choice but to comply, the sound of paint cans was blatantly obvious, yet Kesshu didn&rsquo;t seem too mad, he only had the nostalgia in the rattle of the cans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, graffiti? Any targets in particular?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No, I just wanted to find a victim wall.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, I know what we&rsquo;re going to vandalise, c&rsquo;mon, I&rsquo;ll take you there, it is night time isn&rsquo;t it, also take this spray mask?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini positioned herself to get back in; following Kesshu out of the house, and wondering where he might be going. Reini knew this route as a route to a train station, adjusting her mask before she saw any cameras outside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Alright, it&rsquo;s not busy here, a train might come,&rdquo; Kesshu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was right, only nobody was in this area. A train comes onto the station and it&rsquo;s very empty so that nobody would notice; well nobody would notice them putting graffiti there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kesshu said &ldquo;Alright, we have to do this quickly, do you have a design in mind-&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In very massive, dripping red spray paint, read the words &lsquo;EVAN RUST CAN FUCK HIMSELF AND IS A MASSIVE CUNT, GIFT TOO!&rsquo; Reini knew what she wanted to write.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Woah kid, I guess you know what you wanna write, in English too, and with the exclamation, grammatically, it&rsquo;s correct but it&rsquo;s not very formal to say, I mean, it&rsquo;s train graffiti,&rdquo; Kesshu exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Whatever, what were you going to make?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A cat.&rdquo; Kesshu replied,&rdquo; It&rsquo;s saying meow, as in, what you just wrote.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A graphic of an abstracted cat was on the other train of the car, it looked cute and it had a speech bubble, it contrasted the curse Reini put on her car, just as Kesshu almost finished, the train went from the station and a small trail of blue paint placed onto the train before Kesshu managed to lift the can away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Whatever, these trains are owned by Gift, they deserve it I guess,&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah okay, c&rsquo;mon kid, let&rsquo;s go to the store, we need to get stuff, and you can get stuff too.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh okay then.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She followed Kesshu out of the empty station and into the convenience store, she browsed around, trying to make the total of what she wanted cheap enough, thinking if she spent too much she would burden him. Kesshu just grabbed whatever he thought would be needed for tomorrow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey, Mr Kawaki, should I get these Crips or these chocolate bread sticks, I'm only allowed one thing, so can you help me pick?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Get the family pack, of both, I want some too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He planned for the rest of the H2L band to come over and meet Reini, more personally because she was going to join the band. And he wanted to cook something tomorrow, maybe a sushi dinner or something, he would always remember how his wife used to like his cooking, though they were competitive with that. What did he want to make? He knew how to make Indian-style curry but that would be too spicy for everyone. What about miso soup or omurice? There were so many good options but he was so stumped.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey Reini, what would you like for dinner tomorrow, when the band comes over?&rdquo; Kesshu asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Something tasty, I always eat instant ramen or convenience meals,&rdquo; Reini replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe he could make a rice-based meal, the curry did sound like a good idea and he did love it very spicy but he knew not everyone could handle the way he wanted, so he would make it mild, and he would also make some handrolls and have some drinks to go around, alcoholic for adults and fizzy pop for kids or anyone below 20 along with some water, also he could make some fries and then make parfait for dessert.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounded like a solid plan, and everyone would love it, he couldn&rsquo;t wait until the next day. Making all those delicious meals for everyone, and Maybe he could make a rice-based meal, the curry did sound like a good idea and he did love it very spicy but he knew not everyone could handle the way he wanted, so he would make it mild, and he would also make some handrolls and have some drinks to go around, alcoholic for adults and fizzy pop for kids or anyone below 20 along with some water, also he could make some fries and then make parfait for dessert. he couldn&rsquo;t wait until the next day. Making all those delicious meals for everyone, and all the joy he would bring. If he was honest, he loved cooking a lot; especially for people who he thought were cool. That kid was cool, she liked drawing and she never wanted to make things difficult. He wishes he could have a kid but his wife was killed on the battlefield. Obviously, Gift was responsible for that, and to top it all off, they took her body and almost killed him. Nobody wants to be in a coma, you can hear everything yet you can do nothing, would that be locked-in syndrome? You are only left with your thoughts to accompany you, thinking about every regret and everything you could have done differently. You aren&rsquo;t given the blessing of death yet you are close to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did he overthink again?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">W he just did that, right there when he was thinking about tomorrow&rsquo;s dinner. He wasn&rsquo;t supposed to do that. It&rsquo;s like he spaced out there, thankfully he dropped nothing, he packed the food into the cupboards himself as if it was only a light load. He wanted to take a break, which he could, he was going to be cooking a lot tomorrow, which was also fun to think about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, now was bedtime or just leisure time, just getting some downtime Ah, bed at last, so comfy and fluffy and he could think about tomorrow, he slept soundly on his bed (a futon) which was plush.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini&rsquo;s day was eventful, so many things happened at once but she was glad to settle down in this very comfy bed, it was so comfy that she could&hellip;cry perhaps. She never in her life had a bed as comfortable as this, even after she escaped, she couldn&rsquo;t afford a bed this comfortable. She didn&rsquo;t want to get up from that bed, she was easily adrift into the night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sun seeps through the windows and calls for everyone to feel its glory and get ready for the day ahead, but something feels&hellip; peculiar, slightly more yet rough. She gets up to check on herself, then to do the bed until she notices she has stained the bed with blood. She neglected to track her cycle but had a rough idea of when it might be, but the stain was still fresh if she took off the cover quickly and washed the hell out of the cover, she could get away with saying it was a juice that was spilt, she took off the mattress cover and vigorously removed the stain with soap and water.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was feeling light-headed today and craving so many things, she wandered into the kitchen. Looking for some food, she was ravenous&hellip; hungry&hellip; starved, every synonym for being deprived of food. She wandered the cabinets for the things she brought the other day until she heard something that was just a little familiar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey Reini, I&rsquo;m making breakfast, no need to raid the kitchen,&rdquo; Kesshu said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini looked at him like a racoon caught rummaging, she wasn&rsquo;t used to &lsquo;making something&rsquo; for breakfast since all she could get were ready-made meals but she didn&rsquo;t like eating breakfast especially if it was carb-based, she wanted to give herself a moment and build up her stomach a little.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Would you like to eat omurice?&rdquo; Kesshu asked</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini nodded her head, and omurice did sound nice. She went to the counter to wait and fidgeted with her fingers as she waited; Kesshu started to prepare the ingredients and genuinely looked like he was enjoying making this, from mixing the eggs to making the rice, he made a beautiful omurice, it was more beautiful than any everyday food ate, he then topped it off with a little bit of ketchup in a smiley face. It was too kind for Reini, she wanted to cry at the generosity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Thanks, thank you so much, this is the best food I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; Reini exclaimed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Woah, try it, but no problem!&rdquo; Kesshu replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini ripped off a piece with some chopsticks, only one bite in and she was impressed with what was meant to be simple food, this was the best meal she had, immediately eating her whole plate, this omurice was so good that it brought her into a state of bliss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kesshu had just made his and Tatsu&rsquo;s breakfast, but he saw Reini was done, so he picked up the empty plate and cleaned it. Honestly, he was glad she liked his cooking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey Reini, this week, Egocube told me to get you into some sort of checkup, we promise we won&rsquo;t do anything you won't like to,&rdquo; Kesshu said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Egocube?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, I haven&rsquo;t mentioned him yet, he&rsquo;s the head of the whole SII force and manages every planet from his supercomputer ship called the supernova, wandering the universe and aiding the oppressed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I see, so he&rsquo;s your boss&rsquo;s boss&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini then left the table and checked her chair to see if anything was left behind, nothing was left on the chair. She heads to the toilet to check if anything is solid yet. Thankfully, her trousers were still clean, but she still needed something. She needed pads. But would a house full of men even have pads, who would be willing to get her pads, she was too embarrassed, she could head out quickly, but first, she needed to check the bathroom cabinets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No pads, she was right, she thought about how much savings she had left, her stomach was still in pain and she could bleed again if it got bad enough, she could black out; after being out of that place for a year, she knows that is not normal. But it would hurt her more if she told anyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She heard a little woosh, and slight pattering, she was slightly surprised but then a blue figure made herself out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hello, I&rsquo;m Mirai Melody, Tatsu might have talked about you and mentioned me, he asked me to introduce myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You must be the shrines- oh, are you that titan thingy Akahana mentioned when she rambled on about this whole job.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, that would be me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai Melody had cyan low-lying pigtails wrapped with more hair at the top of the pigtail, she wore a black-blue kimono with a floral pattern and pink accents and a hairclip of a musical note, the kimono had a less traditional big back bow for an obi but paired with her outfit well, and navy geta sandals, she was also slightly translucent, as if she was a projection.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s okay, I would like to see how much you are capable of, just so I know how much training you need to use the magical keyboard,&rdquo; Mirai Melody asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I have been trained to fight, but I was of no use yet. Now I am of use, why do you need to know how someone, who was made for fighting, fights.&rdquo; Reini said,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, it has been a while for you, this is because I need to polish you up.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We start after the dinner, you should have fun with the girls, you have a fun day ahead, they should come in 15 minutes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh okay, hey Mirai Melody, I need something.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ummm. do you have&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini was too nervous to ask, but she needed pads, would a titan thingy like her even need pads, does she need to get her pads, she prefers heavy pads, and is having a preference like that embarrassing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;By the way, why did you wash the bed cover?&rdquo; Mirai Melody asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh&hellip; I spilt juice on it, I am very sorry.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If blood is human juice then Reini was right, after all, if you squeeze an orange, you get orange juice, if you squeeze a human, you get blood. So, therefore, blood is technically juice. This is some Olympic-level mental gymnastics, if mental gymnastics was a sport, Reini would get gold for anything she manages to think of.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Never mind, where do you keep toiletries, like toilet paper or shampoo.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In the pantry near the first bathroom.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh okay, thanks.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked inside the pantry as she got there&hellip;only one packet of pads, how old were these even? Did Mirai Melody need pads, at least they were still good. She took one and placed the pads in a more obvious place for next time. At least she didn&rsquo;t bleed into her trousers yet, for now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She changed her outfit, to something slightly different, white shoes, big denim overalls held on by straps, a black oversized rhythm game hoodie with a white design, a subtle messenger bag along with white bows on her hair to look somewhat trendy, she only put the shoes out and could slip into them when needed. Right now, the girls aren't coming yet. She decided to just have a bit of rest before she went out into the bustling city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She walked into the living area to put on some tv, she saw Tatsu reading articles on his multi-purpose hard light projector, one of the articles caught her eye, it was headlined &lsquo;</span><b>WRITERS CURSE AT RUST</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;, that was the graffiti she did yesterday with Kesshu, she could make out the words of the article from the distance she was sitting, Tatsu giggled to himself a bit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Mr Otokabe, Are you reading the news?&rdquo; Reini asked,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Why yes, like any other old person,&rdquo; Tatsu replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh okay,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It seems like someone hates rust,&rdquo; Tatsu commented.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That is a good thing?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Certainly, and this is one of the train lines the government runs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I thought Gift owned it.&rdquo; reini said it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you in on a secret, Gift developments is funded by the government and is a human subsidiary of the higher council the higher council runs this planet too! my! I wonder if I&rsquo;m near the vandal?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini knew that he sort of knew but she wouldn&rsquo;t admit it. She continued to watch TV, there was a foreign soap on, in English soap, Reini knew English herself, and even spoke it with her online friend. Flowerlover01. She hadn&rsquo;t talked to her since yesterday. So she opened her phone on the talking app and went into a little conversation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Flowerlover01: I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a hot minute, how is it going?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reimani39: Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe what just happened to me!</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini wanted to tell her but with the whole world at stake? She wouldn&rsquo;t dare risk it or open up this much. She wouldn&rsquo;t want to hurt anyone by doing so, what if Gift is watching, even though this channel is triple encrypted?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Flowerlover01: well? Spill the details! What happened?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reimani39: I got scouted for a job.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Flowerlover01: woah, aren&rsquo;t you 12?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reimani39: I mean, I live alone, I need to survive.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Flowerlover01: I mean I don&rsquo;t but congrats!</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reimani39: yeah, I was reluctant at first but then I thought it would help for my survival.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Flowerlover01: Well, what industry?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reimani39: entertainment.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Flowerlover01: woah, be careful, but good luck!</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reimani39: thanks! I&rsquo;ll be off now!</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Flowerlover01: ok, good luck.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She shut off her device and heard a knock at the door. To see a familiar face surrounded by unfamiliar ones, Akahana, dressed in sweater and winter boots with a crimson cardigan and leggings, and with 3 other women, one was more like a sweet, literally, with colourful hues, mainly pink, and a smiley face, with a woman the same age as her dressed in a more mature look with leopard prints and studded belts, a chunky scarf and heavy makeup, the last one looked younger but wouldn&rsquo;t stand out if she was alone, donning a beige baggy shirt with skirt on top with a navy bag to match her motif.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Akahana, I haven&rsquo;t been introduced yet to these other women&hellip;&rdquo; Reini said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I'm Akahana Carter! Blasian idol sensation Caring heart!&rdquo; Akahana exclaimed.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll let the others introduce themselves!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hiiii! I&rsquo;m Sweet heart! Since we&rsquo;re in a group, you can call me Haruno! Ok? My full name is Haruno Kokoro, and that&rsquo;s my fiance who is dressed in gyaru, Gal heart or Utako Satou! Got that?&rdquo; the bright colourful girl said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That would be me!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll introduce myself, I'm Aoi Fuyu,&rdquo; the more typical-looking girl said. &ldquo;Reini Nanaichi, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was a level of typical looking Reini wished she was, able to blend in easily, unnoticeable and cute as well. Reini wished to be this normal, sometimes she doesn&rsquo;t like that she stands out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh wow, you look so typical,&rdquo; Reini exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aoi was slightly confused but was intrigued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, could you elaborate on that please?&rdquo; Aoi asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she was polite too, oh to be a typical girl, everyone minds your own business and does not look at you weirdly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, uhh&hellip;&rdquo; Reini stammered, &rdquo;I meant that positively, sometimes it takes ages for me to blend in with people, yet you look so unsuspecting, I strive to achieve your level of looking typical.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, between you and me, I am not typical, hehe, my group name is Vixen Heart!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, got it!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed sweet as well, Reini wanted to trust Aoi. They boarded the train to a more prevalent hotspot, Shibuya. Reini didn&rsquo;t have much money left but she wasn&rsquo;t going to let anyone pay for anything for her. They boarded a train, it was a lot more sparse today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, we&rsquo;re here, Wanna come to the arcade?&rdquo; Haruna asked</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, yes sure,&rdquo; Reini answered</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They arrived at the arcade, it was packed and slightly humid but the rhythm games caught her eye, immediately went onto the machine. It was lucky she brought her amusement card.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Haruno has the highest score across all of us.&rdquo; Utako said, &ldquo;I'd like to see you beat her, heh!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, tell her to come here, I play a bit of rhythm games by myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh okay then, she&rsquo;s on that one.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, the one with the dancing floor.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was this dancing game with a sensor panel, the arcade had a dual one so people could compete with each other, Reini had played this game countless times, but now she had to play it against someone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, would you like to compete with me?&rdquo; Haruno exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sure, I heard you&rsquo;re the best one in the group,&rdquo; Reini replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I mean, you&rsquo;re a kid, I would love to put down the difficulty so you could keep it up.&rdquo; Haruno light-heartedly teased her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Nah, put up with the difficulty.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, are ya serious?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Alright, I'll set it to the highest difficulty, I wanna pick a song.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at the highest difficulty, Haruno was actually concerned, she had only recently managed to pass this song in particular at this difficulty, but she was ready. Haruno put herself into position, thinking she might get a full combo this time. Utako, Akahana and Aoi watched as the older girl and the younger girl did some casual competing, yet, Reini looked as if she was doing this with little effort, her choreo as she stomped the incoming notes; Haruno was surprised, no combo chokes, and complex choreography, she didn&rsquo;t look like a sweat desperate for attention, on the other hand, Haruno thought she was less impressive than Reini, how long has this girl played rhythm games? About a year, there was no way she was THIS experienced, something had to be up. When the song finished, Haruno didn&rsquo;t get the combo she wanted, but at least she passed the song. On the other hand, Reini&rsquo;s score was perfect. How was that possible? She hasn&rsquo;t seen everything perfect for that song? Even the top players haven&rsquo;t managed to get this far, to be fair it was a new song, nobody had gotten all perfect, they thought it was impossible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;PLEASE TELL ME YOU GOT THAT ON CAMERA!&rdquo; Haruno exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh yeah, deffo!&rdquo; Akahana replied.</span></p>
