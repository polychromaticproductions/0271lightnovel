all github repositories need a readme, i put this on github so you can download it. please dive through the code and change image directories if your drive is something like c:/... rather than d:/... like my code..

also, please dont use my work or charcters from my work in depictions of any sort of discrimination or immoral activity, please contact us at polychromaticproductions@gmail.com if you see any instances.
