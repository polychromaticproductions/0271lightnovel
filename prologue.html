<h1>PROLOGUE</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Subject 0271.&rdquo; a stern voice shouted.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; a weak voice cried.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was there anything better for her, she was only referred to as a number, but it&rsquo;s better than having nothing to refer to you; she accidentally hit the console in the lab, she didn&rsquo;t mean to but now she was getting punished for that accident because she also accidentally caused things to spill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You spilled flakes of sodium, if the floor was freshly cleaned or if you spilled water by accident, I would have been hurt!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This certainly meant she had to be punished for it. They would take the only books she was allowed to read, she did feel a little pain in her stomach but they would tell her to grow up and not help with it. At least she lives somewhere. At least this lab gave her life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You will be confined to your room after you finish this last test, this is why we never take you out into different rooms to run simple tests, you mess everything up.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; the subject muttered meekly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You better be, now I have to clean this mess.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was nice knowing what she was punished with, at least she could plan out what she could do during that time, even though she was a lab experiment confined to a lab, she still had micro plans and she could just think of something in her head - after all, her head could imagine all these awesome things if she shut her eyes. She was grabbed by the wrist and dragged out of the room, to her quarters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What did she do again?&rdquo; the guard asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientist explained, &ldquo;Oh, she almost put us in danger by hitting the console and&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation was drowned out, and the stomach pains increased but she could deal with it and not waste resources, they all liked subject 4444, she was perfect and didn&rsquo;t have all these developmental &lsquo;difficulties&rsquo;, but if subject 0271 was defective, they would have just gotten rid of her. Besides, 4444 is newer and better at following orders but 0271 doesn&rsquo;t know why she keeps on following the instructions incorrectly even though she knows she is doing exactly as they say. 4444 did have more books.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then heard the door behind her slam, it was deafening and sudden and she didn&rsquo;t like that, but her stomach pains exponentially got worse, but she could sleep it off. She tried to tuck herself into bed and imagine something new, the pain was there but she could hear a girl cackling maliciously.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; 0271 asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room was silent, except for a faint buzzing, it was also dimly lit, and you could see nobody as this was a room with nothing to hide anywhere. 0271 shrugs it off but as soon as she tries to relax, the pain feels like it&rsquo;s stabbing her. She tries to walk to the door but it hurts, she tries to bang on the door and ask for help but all that comes out are winces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;MAN UP! I don&rsquo;t care what&rsquo;s happening!&rdquo; the guard yelled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was on her own, she turned from the door to see a trail of blood, nobody told her about this, was she dying? Is this because she might be sick, she wanted an answer but would the guard even care? She heard the malicious laughing again, now was not the time, blood was</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">dripping from her and she felt nervous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Please&hellip; help&hellip; I&rsquo;m bleeding&hellip;I think I might be dying.&rdquo; 0271 cried.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re faking, aren&rsquo;t you? To get out?&rdquo; the guard sneered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no hope, she was dying, and nobody bleeds this much, she fell to the floor because of the amount of pain she felt, it felt like her insides were being torn out and then sewn back in, and she felt nausea get to her and hit the floor with her knees, she wonders if this is her last moments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who does she even have to say goodbye to?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then hears something laughing in a childish yet sinister way, repeating the same syllables.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ka&hellip;ke&hellip;ra&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those syllables looped followed by some more laughing at random intervals. She saw nobody around her, who was making this noise? She blacked out before she could figure out&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Too long have I been confined, too long I wanted to be free, too long have I been mistreated.&rdquo; a thought echoes in her mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, this wasn&rsquo;t the subject 0271 we saw earlier, this being was filled with vengeance and justice and was ferocious - and it wanted to see blood. It wanted to paint the walls red with the blood of her captors, vengeance is hers and vengeance she will get. She wanted out, but that door&hellip; looked like it would look better if it was ripped off, punching the door, leaving dents but not before grabbing the attention of the guard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m not taking you out, if you don&rsquo;t stop that I&rsquo;ll personally reduce your sustenance and then you can bang on doors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She banged on the door again, leaving a bigger dent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo; Alright, I'm coming in there to teach you a lesson.&rdquo; the guard shouted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Big mistake&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered to herself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the guard opened the door she slid under his feet and leapt off the wall only to stop his screams and cries by squishing his head against the floor and using his gibs that exploded everywhere to paint the sterile hallway a deep shade of crimson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She cackled at the sight while rubbing her cheeks from the blood, it looked much better in red; the white was too dull, and she certainly added character to that hallway. After taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of the gore sprayed everywhere, she footed it and headed for the next area, before that section shutter closed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">personnel five times her size fell and spilt their wonderful gore all over the blank canvas of the hallway, she didn't care if cameras were watching, she was putting her message out there. She wanted vengeance and she would spill the blood of her captors for it, she would get what she wanted. Ah, it was so sweet and beautiful, seeing men crushed like mere insects, she wanted more, she wanted to see them all die.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The place was on full lockdown, trying to contain the subject, but it was like keeping a lion in a cardboard box, futile and useless, besides, all the personnel kept dropping dead. dropping completely dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;ATTENTION! ATTENTION! Subject 0&hellip;2&hellip;7&hellip;1&hellip; breached containment; approach with caution and sedate the subject, threat level; lethal&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continues to sprint across the hallway until she feels something pierce her back, and more come after that, she pulls out one of the things stuck in her back; it&rsquo;s a tranq, but other than that needle that went through her back, she feels nothing but takes out more and the holes on the back of her shirt squirt out some blood and stop, the blood was a different tone to the usual red but before it stopped, the last bit of the blood spray was that familiar crimson colour. She felt mildly irritated but more personnel tried to catch her, each one adding to the pile of corpses in front of her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a trail of corpses behind her, ranging from scientists to guards, she prepares for a final act; killing the remaining personnel in front of her, and kicking the door off, an array of shards falls from the door, and then she leaps gracefully from that hole she made, continuing the laugh from the sheer joy she had today; however, circumstances require an encore as she needs to get over that pesky fence, a thick fence too, but it&rsquo;s a, not a problem, digging tiny groves into the concrete the leaping over the fence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continued to run, as far as she could, she felt unstoppable and free, but now she wanted to rest, today was eventful, so she shut down as the sirens wailed and helicopters searched.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">0271 woke up above a bunch of leaves and moss, she was still stained red but now it was all over her and her hands, she felt like she woke up from a dream that turned out to be real&hellip; she killed people. Won&rsquo;t she get punished for that? What would she do if they found her like this, what would they do about all the people she&rsquo;d killed? She cried because the sirens and helicopters mixed with dogs barking and orders everywhere made her overwhelmed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wanted to scream.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Not too fast, I don&rsquo;t wanna get captured.&rdquo; a voice in her head said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That voice&hellip; it was always in her head, it felt a bit more selfish and yet it was still herself, that rampage was real, and so was the forest, and the trees, and the moon, ahead of her, she observed a bustling city full of activity; she was scared, but she was drawn in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s no going back.</span></p>
