<h1> CHAPTER 2 </H1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini woke up, with some unfolded clothes on top of her, she should have finished packing ages ago, she found a new abandoned apartment, of course, she was taking her PC with her, nobody leaves their rig like that, most of her furniture is from dumps or unwanted or was already in the apartment. She hurriedly finished packing and took anything she found precious. There wasn&rsquo;t much food in the fridge, except one slice of cheesecake, which she decided to finish for herself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a beautiful cheesecake, in texture, visual, and taste, It is too bad she can&rsquo;t buy one every day, only people who are lucky enough get to have such luxuries, it&rsquo;s interesting to think about, about 2 centuries ago, the amount she spent on that cheesecake would have brought her ten times as many, she was sure it would have cost 600 yen rather than closer to 6000. More people means more money is made and companies exploit that, which is very unfair.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to have cheesecake every day&hellip;it&rsquo;s so nice!</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, if she didn&rsquo;t save enough, the meagre amount of money left meant she was just going to have ramen and ready meals for the next week, it wasn&rsquo;t like they were bad, japan has some of the best pre-made food. The desire for something homemade is more prevalent today but she only knows a few recipes which are how to prepare ramen, make spread sandwiches and make salad, which was pretty obvious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She did save birthday money and was telling herself she wanted new supplies, after all, even if it wasn&rsquo;t much, she still wanted to buy something with that money. She finished packing everything into a suitcase and a backpack, it wasn&rsquo;t like she could take the furniture but it wasn&rsquo;t worth keeping, the TV is as old as someone&rsquo;s grandma, not that she has one she knows of but it&rsquo;s just that she knows that it is old, she also put her figures back in their boxes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She headed for the station and bought a ticket to Ginza, one of the many shopping hubs, it would be a very quick ride but a longer walk for her, as trains are very fast, Tokyo is known to be one of only capital mega cities left with blue skies, of course, since she was 12 but still elementary school age, she could just get a child ticket, it wasn&rsquo;t too expensive, she then headed to the first stationary shop she saw.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She browsed across the pens to see if she could get a deal on some, after all, she didn&rsquo;t want to blow money she saved up, she wanted her money&rsquo;s worth. She looked at each pen's price but it was slightly expensive but she saw them as cheaper as a pack of 10, but they missed a few colours, maybe she could get the other colours as well, and a mechanical pencil, as she heard these mechanical pencils are good. But the paper here was a little more expensive than that other store, so she thought it would be better to go to the next store after. She continued to ponder about the pens until she heard something behind her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; a man said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She turned around but was amazed when she saw a person in some sort of fashion she liked, a very dark outfit alt-looking with red accents and a cyber-ish motif, he also wore a mask on top, but she didn&rsquo;t want to stare for too long - it would be very awkward and maybe the person would hate it, so she tried to hurry up with getting pens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You should get the clicky versions, I like clicking.&rdquo; the man said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She did like clicking too but now she doesn&rsquo;t know what to respond with, what did she think before?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Uh, thanks, you too, I like your outfit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did she say you too? What the hell was that?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She shook her head and hurried up to get what she needed, and then she quickly checked out and just slowly went her way to other shops, getting the paper she needed and a white gel pen too because how exactly was she going to make highlights? Thankfully, the paper was in stock and so were many types of white gel pens, she also got some alcohol markers and a skin tone set, she wanted to see if she was interested in buying anything else, and if any figurines were on sale, before leaving. She noticed the guy in the shop again but it wasn't like he noticed her, she just could remember people if she encountered them. After visiting more shops, she decided to sit down and draw what she saw as exercises, and she didn&rsquo;t have anything to do as she didn&rsquo;t attend school but was skilled with a lot of things, she was made to be that way but instead, she rots in her bed all day- today she went out and about instead, appreciating the blue sky on top of her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continued to draw until she met with that same polite but mid-toned bassy voice, she was drawing but it was that guy again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo; Reini asked casually.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Can I sit here, I don&rsquo;t see any free benches. Is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sure, just keep your distance please.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He seemed quite polite, but she was ready to act up if he did anything, but was he going to act up, anyway, you can&rsquo;t be too sure, especially as a young girl who&rsquo;s a lab experiment who had to move out of her house because they were spotted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s okay, can I see what you&rsquo;re drawing?&rdquo; He asked nicely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was reluctant, he was a grown man and a stranger, but it wasn&rsquo;t too embarrassing to show, he might know what she was drawing after all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Umm, here, I&rsquo;m open to criticism,&rdquo; she muttered</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Woah, how old are you, kid? That is one impressive drawing of Hatsune Miku!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, 12, I started to like hatsune miku last year,&rdquo; Reini replied</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, I would say around the same age for me, wow, I&rsquo;m just shocked I&rsquo;m just good at music, sometimes I can doodle haha!.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at music too, I also listen to it obviously,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh okay, who is your favourite artist?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say, Mozart, not because I&rsquo;m a classical nut I mean I do love classical music but Mozart would have loved DAWs, and I just resonate with him, I would have been labelled eccentric like him too if I lived in Europe at that time, but yeah, what about you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I mean I&rsquo;m more into j-pop/core, my favourite in particular is DJ De@THSTALKER .&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(made-up DJ I made for this book)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He froze for a second, but he seemed confident despite his frozen statue-like state, he then took a moment just to process what the girl said to him, he was interested in the conversation, but he just needed a second to process what she just said to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, DJ De@THSTALKER? You know him?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;yes!&rdquo; she proudly exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I mean I know him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Woah, no way! I don&rsquo;t know how to say it. I think he&rsquo;s cool in a &lsquo;wow, how does he do 7 polyrhythms at once in his newest song&rsquo; kind of way, wish I could see him in real life, it would be so awesome!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was pleased to see this fan happy, but unexpectedly, he reached for something out of his pocket and brought out 2 slips of paper with writing, well, they did have barcodes on them but they were still printed and could be scanned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I have a spare ticket, I don&rsquo;t have a friend to bring so you can have my spare ticket, I honestly don&rsquo;t know what to do with this ticket, but I know I&rsquo;m not selling it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was in disbelief, his show sold out in minutes and she wanted to go. Still, she had no money at the time, and this was generous of him, she was super thankful for this, so much so she couldn&rsquo;t string together words to even think of anything to say to this generous stranger she met, but she wasn&rsquo;t too sure if it was too good to be true. Still, she could always defend herself from people after all, she can carry 5 times her body weight with ease.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Woah, this is too generous if it isn&rsquo;t too good to be true.&rdquo; Reini gasped &ldquo;Are you sure? As in are you doing this?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yeah, I Said I Didn&rsquo;t have another friend to give it to.&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;, keep that ticket&rsquo;&rdquo; he replied</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No way, I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She froze in disbelief as she stared at his tickets, it felt wrong to take them, but she did want to go to that concert, as soon as she thought about just looking at them, she felt something loom over her; it felt like a threatening shadow, it felt massive and it felt like it wanted to eat her, like a monster looking for prey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man picked up on this and immediately looked at the big person behind her, he knew that uniform was for anyone working for gift developments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Would you care to explain what you are doing with this girl?&rdquo; the woman standing asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my daughter, she has good grades and it was her birthday recently, I just wanted to treat her,&rdquo; he replied</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Really? Hey little girl, if he&rsquo;s doing anything bad, follow me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini knows this woman&rsquo;s intentions are bad, she feels like she might know that she is a target, but Reini decides to play along.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; Reini cried.&rdquo; he&rsquo;s my dad, how dare you make such accusations about him!&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, the woman backed off, her face wandering in guilt as she awkwardly tried to think of something to reply with. Reini continued to act offended as the woman lingered near her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;My bad.&rdquo; the woman sheepishly mutters, &ldquo;I thought he might be one of those uni students trying to get with a school girl&hellip;you know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Wow&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know if I should feel offended or complimented, I am way past university age, and I have no business talking to girls who aren&rsquo;t my children or relatives or any I have responsibility over.&rdquo; the man said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I am sorry, I&rsquo;ll leave you alone.&rdquo; the woman apologised</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No, we are going, c&rsquo;mon Hikari.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini knew that was not her name and he was not her dad but she knew he had to come up with something, so she picked up all her things and followed him, she knew he felt a bit safe but she didn&rsquo;t know to trust her gut feeling, but if he also felt that woman was someone bad, then why did he try to help her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh okay, Dad.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She followed him because she also knew that woman was bad, she saw her in the lab one time and recognised her slightly; a cold demeanour and heartless breath.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah thanks, where are we going?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Somewhere where nobody can pry on us, nobody like them,&rdquo; he replied</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I felt someone bad too, how did you know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I know many things like your name isn&rsquo;t Hikari.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She froze for a second but let him continue, she could defend herself if something went wrong, it wasn&rsquo;t like this grown man had any moves up his sleeve, but Reini did. She could do something with her bare hands, but she wouldn&rsquo;t act up right now as he hadn&rsquo;t done anything too bad but seemed to want to protect her. It would be useful to read his mind, maybe just once, he seems like a nice person, but Reini doesn&rsquo;t know for sure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Good, they aren&rsquo;t listening here,&rdquo; he said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Someone was listening, weren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Reini added</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Usually, I&rsquo;m sure you know who monitors public places unless I have the wrong person.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Reini asked, &ldquo;I did save your ass back there, it was my birthday yesterday, and a magical girl told me I was one too.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Akahana?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You know her?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I mean this is how I know your name is not Hikari,&rdquo; he continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, who or what are you and what do you guys want with me,&rdquo; Reini asked again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You want the whole explanation, won&rsquo;t sugarcoat it, especially knowing how Gift is looking for an experiment that escaped.&rdquo; the man answered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So you know what I am.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the job of the SII to know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What is the SII?&rdquo; Reini asked</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The SII or the Secretnova interplanetary intelligence is an underground resistance working against the interests of the high council for the interests of civilians across the universe who are oppressed wrongfully by the higher council and all known operations led by them; including GIFT INC. and all subsidiaries; due to the recent event of the magical keyboard choosing a wielder, I have to protect you as per orders of the SII.&rdquo; the man explained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Woah, even I haven&rsquo;t heard of you guys,&rdquo; Reini replied</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I haven&rsquo;t introduced myself, my name is Kesshu Kawaki, and I am the Vice operations director of the Earth branch.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Woah, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard of a name like that, I&rsquo;m subject 0271, or just Reini Nanaichi.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I mean, your name is just numbers.&rdquo; Kesshu said, &ldquo;You need a better name.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It works for me, I think your name is like a character I would see in a piece of media, it&rsquo;s just so unique yet symbolic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rare way to think of my name.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Eh, anyways, do you need something from me?&rdquo; Reini asked</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Kid, make sure that&hellip;a weapon that trusts you doesn&rsquo;t fall into the wrong hands, got that?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Let me guess, something about the fate of the universe.&rdquo; Reini teased &ldquo;Yeah I comprehend that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini knew he was serious, Gift developments are no joke, they would erase anyone who opposed them or dared question their authority. As soon as you ask the slightest question, you no longer exist, it was lucky Kesshu was somehow alive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey, Mr Kawaki, how are you still alive even though you are not a big fan of gift developments?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, I barely stayed alive.&rdquo; Kesshu said as he pulled his oversized trouser leg slightly to reveal braces, &rdquo; I don&rsquo;t cover these braces, I like wearing baggy trousers, and sometimes I may use crutches, you can feel free to ask me how I ended up like this..&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini was curious but not rude, she felt it would be improper to ask about how someone is how they are, but he said it was okay, if one is negative, should she still go ahead and ask or is it an AND gate? She felt like she would ask when the time was right, but not now, she was following him somewhere because she didn&rsquo;t know what to do or where to go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Excuse me, am I meant to follow you, sir?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, yes, trying to find you would be hard.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini continued to follow him, it was dark and she was currently homeless, she could follow this guy who was a spy of sorts or just wander off. But she followed him onto the train, they were heading somewhere near what she considered hotspots. The train was less packed today but she was tall enough to grab onto the strap-hanger and her suitcase on the other hand, as she would only take a short ride across the city of Tokyo. She got off the train as she saw Kesshu signalling to her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey, sir, would you have anywhere for me to stay, like a sofa or something?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure we have more than that at the SII, my boss has cleared his day just to meet you, Akahana told us that the magical keyboard chose you, we knew we had to protect you because you might be inexperienced because you&rsquo;re young.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say I am inexperienced.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, show me later, you need to meet my boss, you may or may not know him, not personally but you might recognise him,&rdquo; Kesshu added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, I'll be sure to keep an eye out, sir.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah look, we've arrived here!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A shrine?&rdquo; Reini inquired.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yeah, We've made sure there's no Gift interference, by buying out any of the empty spaces nearby and handing them to any small businesses, plus, we live near hotspots like Kitazawa and Shibuya and Shinjuku, plus, we&rsquo;re a train ride away from Ginza, I think you know that, we just went from Ginza!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Everywhere in Japan is just a train ride away, I could take a train to Sapporo if I wanted to.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yeah, but you won&rsquo;t, as you need to meet my boss, because his boss in space said so and his co-director in Neo York said I should bring you here, it&rsquo;s a whole bunch of they said and they did.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So, am I meant to join the SII if I become a magical girl.&rdquo; Reini inquired again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;He will explain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah&hellip; okay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Now, wait here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini sat outside on the stairs while she waited for him to do what he needed to do, the shrine wasn&rsquo;t too big or too small but it looked somewhat sublime, it still maintained its traditional appearance despite the surrounding skyscrapers, she then heard the door behind her slide, it was Kesshu again but he looked like he needed something from her; the room behind him emitted an amber glow, that of a candle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hey Reini, he wants to see you now, I have some spare socks, they&rsquo;re still in the pack, you can take my fan.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, okay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took her shoes off and left them outside. She went in through the door slowly, hanging her coat and bag onto a coat hanger, seeing a table set in front of her and a scroll with a miniature bonsai below, she didn&rsquo;t remember well what she was meant to do, bring a fan but don&rsquo;t use it, was she meant to look at the scroll, nobody was there yet, she looked at the table; it was low for kneel-sitting, the table had small pottery of consistent yet varying sizes, one of the bowls was filled with matcha and there was a teapot, the porcelain was intricately decorated with a gradual border of florals and vines, this single cup alone looked more expensive than anything she owned, even her limited edition figure of that virtual singer she liked. She turned the cup around, facing the pattern to her face. She didn&rsquo;t have a kimono on but put something on less raggedy to go outside when she moved out, wearing a black waist-high skirt with shorts underneath, knee-high socks with pastel blue stripes at the top that she replaced with the socks she was given, she had a pastel blue sleeveless sweater layered on top of a white button-up and a black ribbon tried into a bow on her shirt collar and a blue headband on top of her loose hair, her face was basic in terms of what was on it, she had no make-up on, a slight tint of a natural red on her face and her pores were all clear but visible, she didn&rsquo;t know how to put make-up nor did she like putting anything on her face, but it would be fun to learn, usually, she doesn&rsquo;t go outside so she sees no need.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She saw the door behind the table slide and an aged man but slightly, he looked well off from what she could tell by his clothes, they looked new and tailored rather than second-hand and his whole appearance was well-kempt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Excuse me, you must be Reini?&rdquo; the old man asked as he sat down. &ldquo;I have heard about you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then offered her some mochi, it looked well made and there was a small variety, but it looked interesting to eat and it was arranged like a flower, she wanted to put that in her mouth because it looked way more interesting to eat than the bland mochi she was given on new years when she was given in the lab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Wow, I mean&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t, how much did this cost?&rdquo; Reini declined modestly</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, I insist, you are my guest.&rdquo; the Old Man replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Okay, which is the pink one, strawberry?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, I get my mochi from a local shop, I am sure you may recognise what Otokabe Records is, right?&rdquo; the old man replied. </span><b>(A made-up record label that means &lsquo;sound wall/barrier&rsquo; [音壁]).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, no way! you guys manage DJ DE@STALKER&rsquo;s music and HeartHeart2Love, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, and other talents.&rdquo; the old man continued, &ldquo;and even international talents under us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Alright, you must be the co-directions operator Mr. Kawaki was talking about, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, and the CEO of Otokabe Records, Tatsu Otokabe, That guy outside, is DJ DE@STALKER; and my son-in-law,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Wha- no way, !?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hm, I guess he didn&rsquo;t tell you, he is like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I mean I understand, he makes so much music for things, He said he didn&rsquo;t have a friend to go to the concert.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And did he try to give you tickets, Akahana did tell me she saw a t-shirt from the H2L and DE@THSTALKER collab, she told me it was from that merch collection we released years ago, she&rsquo;s observant.&rdquo; Tatsu remarks</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, I know that now, I got that shirt from a thrift store about a few months ago,&rdquo; Reini replied</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I see, but I need to discuss something dire&hellip;.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Alright&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As you may understand, we have many personnel in the SII, for example, remember Kesshu? He helped a lot during WW3, but a severe injury left him in a coma; he got paralysed with no chance of walking again; by some miracle, physiotherapy worked, but not all things can be fixed, even with what&rsquo;s out there, there&rsquo;s nothing to revive heroes or innocent people...&rdquo; Tatsu stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo; Reini muttered.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, the keyboard knows there is a new hero to wield it but I&rsquo;m as reluctant as you, Mirai Melody says it&rsquo;s time for the magical keyboard to have a new holder.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini understood how he felt, but she was intrigued to ask more about the history. Would it be rude to?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the history behind these, the instruments?&rdquo; Reini asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Long ago&hellip; my ancestor made these instruments with the one called the higher being, under many names across the universe, even on our earth they go by many names, Kami-Sama may be a name you recognise.&rdquo; Tatsu explained, &ldquo;The higher being told my ancestor that this is a power for the people to protect themselves and it shouldn&rsquo;t fall into the wrong hands, my ancestor was a mere instrument maker who made instruments for the best entertainers and even the nobility at the time, but he was a humble family man who was honest and charitable and the higher being saw good in him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Reini muttered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The responsibility of making sure the instruments have been passed down through my family, and we were blessed with an ability the higher being gave my ancestor, the power of music itself.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I'm the last person in my line after my wife and daughter died, I&rsquo;ve been looked after by Kesshu because he insists.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, my condolences, what happened.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I know it was Gift, The medic tried to get what was left of my daughter after grabbing Kesshu but she was too late as the Gift Taskforce stormed in, they barely escaped.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I too have my reasons why I hate Gift.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini was hurt thinking about gift developments and everything. She shivered a little and felt her hand spasm as she tried to forget the awful things they had done, to her especially, she went quiet as she didn&rsquo;t want to speak. Tatsu could see how uneasy Reini seemed as she froze. He nudged the plate a little towards Reini and kindly looked at her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You can have another bit of mochi,&rdquo; Tatsu whispered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you&hellip; run out of mochi?&rdquo; Reini asked</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsu knew how innocent that question was, he wasn&rsquo;t going to run out, he could set the tea ceremony, pay for everything and have one every day for the rest of his life if he wanted to, and still have money left over. He wanted to make sure this girl felt welcome as she had no parents and she needed a reliable parent figure, and he wanted to make sure he met potentially the newest member/instrument wielder of his team; if she accepted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I can buy you mochi every day if you want,&rdquo; Tatsu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No, I can save up if I want to.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reini knew his intentions were good. However, she didn&rsquo;t want to be a leech, she would never use anyone&rsquo;s money or money she had no right to. She slowly took another ball of mochi and rubbed her hands as she waited to finish chewing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I see, but can you afford somewhere to live.&rdquo; Tatsu continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, this was something Reini hadn&rsquo;t arranged yet, but she would be sure to get to it, she could live independently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; Reini muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a place.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You think you are independent, but, it&rsquo;s unconscious incompetence, in terms of&hellip; you need help.&rdquo; Tatsu said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived alone for about a year?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Barely able to afford anything?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, old man wisdom, but Reini couldn't accept that he was right, however confident and independent she seemed, she finished the last of the tea and did all the etiquette she somehow managed to learn.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes sir, thanks for the meeting,&rdquo; Reini said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my honour, come to a decision yet?&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She gave herself more time to think. She knew these instruments had to be used by the right people, and they knew best. She couldn&rsquo;t deny it anymore. Considering she can also get the chance to take down her tormentors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I have, I understand the risks if it falls into the wrong hands.&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, welcome to H2L, you can meet the members tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, she had a team now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better than nothing. right?</span></p>
